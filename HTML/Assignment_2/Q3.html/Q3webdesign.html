 <h1> Web Design</h1>
 <p>Web designing is the process of planning,
conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for
designing a website in a way that is functional and
offers a good user experience. User experience is
central to the web designing process. Websites have an
array of elements presented in ways that make them
easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves
working on every attribute of the website that people
interact with, so that the website is simple and
efficient, allows users to quickly find the information
they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors,
when combined, decide how well the website is
designed.
