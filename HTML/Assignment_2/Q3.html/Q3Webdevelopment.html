 <h1>Web Development</h1>
 <p>
 Web development is the work involved in
developing a website for the Internet (World Wide
Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
development can range from developing a simple
single static page of plain text to complex web
applications, electronic businesses, and social network
services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which
Web development commonly refers, may include Web
engineering, Web design, Web content development,
client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web
server and network security configuration, and ecommerce development.
